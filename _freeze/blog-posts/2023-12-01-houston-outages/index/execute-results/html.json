In particular, you will use the VNP46A1 to detect differences in night lights before and after the storm to identify areas that lost electric power.\n\nTo determine the number of homes that lost power, you link (spatially join) these areas with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84) data on buildings and roads.\n\nTo investigate potential socioeconomic factors that influenced recovery, you will link your analysis with data from the US Census Bureau.\n\n##### Highlights:\n\n-   load vector/raster data\\\n-   simple raster operations\\\n-   simple vector operations\\\n-   spatial joins\n\n### Data\n\n#### Night lights\n\nNASA's Worldview was used to explore the data around the day of the storm. There are several days with too much cloud cover to be useful, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.\n\nVIIRS data is distributed through NASA's [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. We therefore need to download two tiles per date.\n\n#### Roads\n\nTypically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google's [Earth at Night](https://earth.google.com/web/@27.44405464,-84.7693044,206.63660162a,8916361.52264659d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)). To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, we will ignore areas near highways.\n\n[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project which creates publicly available geographic data of the world. Ingesting this data into a database where it can be subsetted and processed is a large undertaking. Fortunately, third party companies redistribute OSM data. We used [Geofabrik's download sites](https://download.geofabrik.de/) to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (`.gpkg` file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area.Â \n\n#### Houses\n\nBuilding data was obtained from OpenStreetMap. We again downloaded from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.\\\n\n#### Socioeconomic\n\nWe cannot readily get socioeconomic information for every home, so instead we obtained data from the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019. The *folder* `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb` is an ArcGIS [\"file geodatabase\"](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/administer-file-gdbs/file-geodatabases.htm), a multi-file proprietary format that's roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file.\\\n\nYou can use `st_layers()` to explore the contents of the geodatabase. Each layer contains a subset of the fields documents in the [ACS metadata](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/tiger/prejoined/ACSMetadata2011.txt).\\\n\nThe geodatabase contains a layer holding the geometry information, separate from the layers holding the ACS attributes. We combined the geometry with the attributes to get a feature layer that `sf` can use.\n\n##Exploration\n\nData was loaded in and converted to a `stars` object in order to be used with the `sf` package. The night light tiles were combined to form mosaics for February 7th, 2021 and February 16th, 2021.\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(spData)\nlibrary(spDataLarge)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(ggspatial)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read in night lights tiles\nnight1 <- read_stars('data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif')\nnight2 <- read_stars('data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif')\nnight3 <- read_stars('data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif')\nnight4 <- read_stars('data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif')\n\n# check class of night light tiles\nclass(night1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"stars\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# combine tiles into stars object for 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16\nnight_07 <- st_mosaic(night1, night2)\nnight_16 <- st_mosaic(night3, night4)\n\n# view 2021-02-07 raster\nplot(night_07, main = \"Raster of 2021-02-07\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\ndownsample set to 6\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo find the change in night lights intensity (presumably) caused by the storm we will create a blackout mask.

Additionally, when comparing the median incomes of homes affected and not affected the distributions appear to be similar for the spread of wealth. Residents not impacted by the storm do appear to have slightly higher median incomes which could coincide with living farther outside the city center in the suburbs of Houston. A limitation of this analysis is that we did reduce the number of buildings counted that fell close to highways, which could be areas that have lower median incomes. Additionally, in exploring the power outages in Houston, TX we only compared the blackouts from the first two storms, without accounting for the third storm. Without accounting for the third storm the total number of outages that occurred is being underestimated.**\n",
