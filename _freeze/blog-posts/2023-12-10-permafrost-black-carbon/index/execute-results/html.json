Underneath our homes, creating landscapes and environments we like to recreate in and also a vital carbon sink. Soil, and especially permafrost soils, play a key role in storing greenhouse gases and releasing greenhouse gases as they warm. A permafrost soil is defined as a frozen soil that is at or below zero degrees Celcius, and has been for at least two years [@nationalsnowandicedatacenter]. Climate change and climate change modeling varies widely on predicting the fate and impacts of permafrost soils [@zhu2019], but what are some of the main drivers behind permafrost melt?\n\nUltimately, the main driver behind permafrost melt is temperature. And the obvious thought is of course a warmer temperature will lead to warmer soil temperatures which will ultimately warm permafrost soils to the point where they are no longer frozen. As a broad overview this thought process works, however there are other drivers that determine soil temperature. Soil properties such as soil organic carbon, soil texture, bulk density, and soil moisture all impact how soils respond to temperature. However, it has been shown that soil organic carbon can be the dominant determinant of soil temperature in permafrost soils [@zhu2019]. One way soils build up soil organic carbon is through the deposition of black carbon [@kopecký2021].\n\nBlack carbon is predominantly present as products of incomplete combustion [@environmentalprotectionagency2016] . By incomplete combustion we are talking about soot from wildfires, fossil fuels, and biofuels. As temperature regimes continue to change globally the cadence of black carbon from inputs like wildfires can also be expected to shift.\n\nTherefore a question that comes to mind with these findings are if air temperature and black carbon levels both affect soil temperature, can they predict soil temperature and in the process is air temperature and black carbon interacting with each other?\n\nTo explore this question further data from Toolik Field Station, AK will be explored. The Toolik Field Station is a research station operated and managed by the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks with cooperative agreement support from the Division of Polar Programs, Directorate for Geosciences at the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\n![](toolik_station.jpeg){fig-alt=\"photo of Toolik Field Station, AK\"}\n\n## Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# import necessary libraries\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(tufte)\nlibrary(feasts)\nlibrary(tsibble)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\n```\n:::\n\n\n[Soil Temperature]{.underline}\n\nSoil Temperature data was accessed from the publicly available Meteorological Data Query from Lake Toolik Field Station [@environmentaldatacenterteam]. The soil temperature marker utilized for this analysis was the soil temperature for the first 150 centimeters of the soil profile from 2019 to 2022.

Our interaction model provides us with three hypotheses:\n\n[Hypothesis 1]{.underline}\n\nOur first null hypothesis is that there is no effect of air temperature in degrees Celsius on soil temperature in degrees Celsius. The alternative hypothesis being that there is an affect of air temperature in degrees Celsius on soil temperature in degrees Celsius. We find a statistically significant effect whereby increases in air temperature degrees Celsius increase soil temperature in degrees Celsius holding black carbon fixed. We estimate that a 1 degrees Celsius increase in air temperature increases soil temperature by 0.06 (±.03, p=.07) degrees Celsius. Therefore we reject the null hypothesis that air temperature does not have an affect on soil temperature (at a significance level of 0.05).\n\n[Hypothesis 2]{.underline}\n\nOur second null hypothesis is that there is no effect of black carbon in ug/m3 on soil temperature in degrees Celsius. The alternative hypothesis being that there is an effect of black carbon in ug/m3 on soil temperature in degrees Celsius. We find a statistically significant effect whereby increases in air temperature degrees Celsius increase soil temperature in degrees Celsius holding air temperature in degrees Celsius fixed. We estimate that a 1 percent increase in black carbon in ug/m3 will decrease soil temperature by 0.0036 (±.17, p=.03) degrees Celsius. Therefore we reject the null hypothesis that black carbon does not have an affect on soil temperature (at a significance level of 0.01).\n\n[Hypothesis 3]{.underline}\n\nOur third hypothesis is that the effect of black carbon on soil temperature varies across temperatures, since warmer temperatures could coincide with higher wildfire incidences. However, we do not find a statistically significant effect whereby the impact of air temperature differs for levels of black carbon present on soil temperature. The interaction term is very slightly positive but overall insignificant within our model.\n\nThe adjusted R2 values also increased slightly (from 0.173 to 0.179) when adding the interaction model. This demonstrates that the interaction model just slightly increases model fit.\n\nHowever, this adjusted R2 value also indicates that only about 17% of the variability in soil temperature is explained by the model. With this information, we can hypothesize that there are other factors that affect soil temperature not included within this model.\n\n## Time Series\n\nAn additional consideration to take into account is that we know temperature experiences seasonality, but does black carbon also fluctuate throughout the year? To investigate this component we will be exploring black carbon levels across time.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# turn permafrost df into tsibble for decompostion\npermafrost <- as_tsibble(full) %>% \n  fill_gaps()\n\n# filter dataset to 2019-2021\npermafrost_2020 <- permafrost %>% \n  filter(between(date, as.Date('2019-12-29'), as.Date('2021-01-03')))\n\n# graph the time series \npermafrost_2 <- permafrost_2020 %>% \n  mutate(date = date(date)) %>%\n  ggplot(., aes(x = date, y = log_b_c)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = 'Date', y = 'log(black carbon) (ug/m3)', title = 'Time Series of Black Carbon Levels from 2019 to 2021') +\n  theme_linedraw()\n\npermafrost_2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn viewing this time series of the data from December of 2019 to January of 2021 we are able to get a continuous glimpse of black carbon levels over time. It does appear that there could be an outlier occurring in September of 2020, but overall there is not a large indicator of trend or seasonality. Upon further research September 2020 had multiple large fires burning in the Pacific Northwest whose smoke and associated particulate matter reached Alaska @mass2021 . If we examine the full timeline of data present:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npermafrost_full <- permafrost %>% \n  filter(between(date, as.Date('2019-12-29'), as.Date('2023-11-19')))\n\npermafrost_3 <- permafrost_full %>% \n  mutate(date = date(date)) %>%\n  ggplot(., aes(x = date, y = log_b_c)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = 'Date', y = 'log(black carbon) (ug/m3)', title = 'Time Series of Black Carbon Levels from 2019 to 2023') +\n  theme_linedraw()\n\npermafrost_3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that there does not appear to be a relationship of seasonality or trend present. Unfortunately, the air sensor did not collect data from mid-September of 2021 to March of 2022. This hole in the data is not marked in the documentation of the data, but could have resulted from a sensor error. Additionally we see a very high black carbon level in September of 2022. I predict that this value comes from the fact that 2022 is considered one of Alaska's biggest fire seasons since 1950 with over three million acres burned @rosen2022. This gap prevents a decomposition from being run on the entire timescale of data we have that would help determine if seasonality were an important component. However, we can examine a decomposition run from 2019 to 2020 to help determine if there is a trend present in the black carbon levels. Due to the appearance of a few outliers in our data notably September of 2020 a Seasonal and Trend Decomposition using Loess was chosen for its robustness to outliers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npermafrost_decomp <- permafrost_2020 %>% \n  model(STL(log_b_c, type = \"additive\")) %>% \n  components() %>% \n  autoplot() +\n  labs(title = \"STL decomposition of black carbon levels at Toolik Field Station, AK\")\n\npermafrost_decomp\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom our decomposition model we can see that for black carbon levels there is no definitive trend and that the remainder component is more important than the trend for black carbon levels. As the amount of data recorded from the purple air sensor increases running this test again could be beneficial to determine if seasonality plays a role.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nWith this initial analysis we can conclude that air temperature and black carbon do have an effect on soil temperature. However, we can also see that their are factors that we have not addressed in this model to account for more of the variation in soil temperature.\n\nAdditional research and analysis should be done surrounding this topic. This analysis is spatially limited to Toolik Field Station in Alaska and its immediate surrounding area. This analysis could be extended to a larger geographic area of permafrost coverage. Additionally, this analysis would benefit from additional and extended data. Toolik Field Station has data on air temperature and soil temperature since 1988. However, the purple sensor which is able to record the black carbon levels, was installed in 2019. Thus, as black carbon is the main interest for my question I think it would benefit from additional time. This could also allow for a next step to be a decomposition model that is able to address seasonality.\n\nTo see the full repository, check out the project on [Github](https://github.com/mwidas/permafrost-black-carbon)\n",
