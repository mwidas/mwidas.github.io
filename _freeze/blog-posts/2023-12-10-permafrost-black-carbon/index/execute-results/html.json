Underneath our homes, creating landscapes and environments we like to recreate in and also a vital carbon sink. Soil, and especially permafrost soils, play a key role in storing greenhouse gases and releasing greenhouse gases as they warm. A permafrost soil is defined as a frozen soil that is at or below zero degrees celcius, and has been for at least two years [@nationalsnowandicedatacenter]. Climate change and climate change modeling varies widely on predicting the fate and impacts of permafrost soils [@zhu2019], but what are some of the main drivers behind permafrost melt?\n\nUltimately, the main driver behind permafrost melt is temperature. And the obvious thought is of course a warmer temperature will lead to warmer soil temperatures which will ultimately warm permafrost soils to the point where they are no longer frozen. As a broad overview this thought process works, however there are other drivers that determine soil temperature. Soil properties such as soil organic carbon, soil texture, bulk density, and soil moisture all impact how soils respond to temperature. However, it has been shown that soil organic carbon can be the dominant determinant of soil temperature in permafrost soils [@zhu2019]. One way soils build up soil organic carbon is through the deposition of black carbon [@kopeck√Ω2021].\n\nBlack carbon is predominantly present as products of incomplete combustion [@environmentalprotectionagency2016] . By incomplete combustion I am referring to soot from wildfires, fossil fuels, and biofuels. As temperature regimes continue to change globally the cadence of black carbon from wildfires will also shift.\n\nTherefore a question that comes to mind with these findings are if air temperature and black carbon levels both affect soil temperature can they predict soil temperature and in the process are air temperature and black carbon interacting with each other?\n\nTo explore this question further data from Toolik Field Station, AK will be explored. The Toolik Field Station is a research station operated and managed by the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks with cooperative agreement support from the Division of Polar Programs, Directorate for Geosciences at the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\n## Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# import necessary libraries\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(tufte)\nlibrary(feasts)\nlibrary(tsibble)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\n```\n:::\n\n\n[Soil Temperature]{.underline}\n\nSoil Temperature data was accessed from the publicly available Meteorological Data Query from Lake Toolik Field Station [@environmentaldatacenterteam]. The soil temperature marker utilized for this analysis was the soil temperature for the first 150 cm of the soil profile from 2019 to 2022. All measurements were measured in degrees celcius, and recorded every three hours. For this analysis measurements recorded at the 300 hour mark each week were utilized.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load data that has soil temperature in degrees Celcius for first 150 cm\nsoil <- read_csv(here(\"blog-posts\", \"2023-12-10-permafrost-black-carbon\", \"data\",\"3-hour_data.csv\"))\n\n# create updated soil temperature df\nsoil_2 <- soil %>% \n  # choose all values recorded at hour 300\n  filter(hour == \"300\") %>%\n  # remove hour column\n  subset(select = -hour) %>%\n  # rename column for readability\n  rename(soil_temp = soil1_150cm) \n```\n:::\n\n\n[Air Temperature]{.underline}\n\nAir Temperature data was accessed from the publicly available Meteorological Data Query from Lake Toolik Field Station [@environmentaldatacenterteam].

To quantify black carbon Particulate Matter 2.5 ug/m3 was used.
