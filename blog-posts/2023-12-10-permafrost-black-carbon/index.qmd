## Background

Soil is all around us. Underneath our homes, creating landscapes and environments we like to recreate in and also a vital carbon sink. Soil, and especially permafrost soils, play a key role in storing greenhouse gases and releasing greenhouse gases as they warm. A permafrost soil is defined as a frozen soil that is at or below zero degrees celcius, and has been for at least two years [@nationalsnowandicedatacenter]. Climate change and climate change modeling varies widely on predicting the fate and impacts of permafrost soils [@zhu2019], but what are some of the main drivers behind permafrost melt?

Ultimately, the main driver behind permafrost melt is temperature. And the obvious thought is of course a warmer temperature will lead to warmer soil temperatures which will ultimately warm permafrost soils to the point where they are no longer frozen. As a broad overview this thought process works, however there are other drivers that determine soil temperature. Soil properties such as soil organic carbon, soil texture, bulk density, and soil moisture all impact how soils respond to temperature. However, it has been shown that soil organic carbon can be the dominant determinant of soil temperature in permafrost soils [@zhu2019]. One way soils build up soil organic carbon is through the deposition of black carbon [@kopeck√Ω2021].

Black carbon is predominantly present as products of incomplete combustion [@environmentalprotectionagency2016] . By incomplete combustion I am referring to soot from wildfires, fossil fuels, and biofuels.

Therefore a question that comes to mind with these findings are if air temperature and black carbon levels both affect soil temperature can they predict soil temperature and in the process are air temperature and black carbon interacting with each other?

To explore this question further data from Toolik Field Station, AK will be explored. The Toolik Field Station is a research station operated and managed by the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks with cooperative agreement support from the Division of Polar Programs, Directorate for Geosciences at the National Science Foundation (NSF).

## Data

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# import necessary libraries
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)
library(gt)
library(tufte)
library(feasts)
library(tsibble)
library(sjPlot)
```

[Soil Temperature]{.underline}

Soil Temperature data was accessed from the publicly available Meteorological Data Query from Lake Toolik Field Station. The soil temperature marker utilized for this analysis was the soil temperature for the first 150 cm of the soil profile. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
# load data that has soil temperature in degrees Celcius for first 150 cm
soil <- read_csv(here("blog-posts", "2023-12-10-permafrost-black-carbon", "data","3-hour_data.csv"))

# create updated soil temperature df
soil_2 <- soil %>% 
  # choose all values recorded at hour 300
  filter(hour == "300") %>%
  # remove hour column
  subset(select = -hour) %>%
  # rename column for readability
  rename(soil_temp = soil1_150cm) 
```

[Air Temperature]{.underline}

Air Temperature data was accessed from the publicly available Meteorological Data Query from Lake Toolik Field Station. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
# load data that contains air temperature in degrees celcius for Toolik Field Station, Alaska
air_temp <- read_csv(here("blog-posts", "2023-12-10-permafrost-black-carbon", "data", "24-hour_data.csv"))

# create updated air temperature df
air_temp_updated <- air_temp %>% 
  select(air_temp_max_3m, date) %>% # select columns to keep
  rename(air_temp = air_temp_max_3m) # rename air_temp for readability
```

[Black Carbon]{.underline}

Black Carbon data was accessed from a citizen science 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# load data that contains pm2.5 which will be used as a representation of black carbon
black_carbon <- read_csv(here("blog-posts", "2023-12-10-permafrost-black-carbon", "data", "us-epa-pm25-aqi.csv"))

# black carbon date information is stored as POSIXct so switch to date type
black_carbon$DateTime <- as.Date(black_carbon$DateTime) 

# create updated black carbon dataframe
black_carbon_2 <- black_carbon %>% 
  # rename date column to match other df's
  rename(date = DateTime) %>%  
  # average the two field station measurements
  mutate(b_c = (`Toolik Field Station A`+`Toolik Field Station B`)/2) %>% 
  # b_c is not normally distributed so take log to correct for this
  mutate(log_b_c = (log(b_c)+1)) %>% 
  # remove unecessary columns
  subset(select = -c(Average,`Toolik Field Station A`, `Toolik Field Station B`))  
  
# change -Inf values created by log function to 0 to allow regressions to run
black_carbon_2$log_b_c[black_carbon_2$log_b_c == -Inf] <- 0 
```

```{r}
# create new df containing black carbon and soil temp data
combined_bc_st <- left_join(black_carbon_2, soil_2, by = 'date')

# create new df with black carbon, soil temp, and air temp data
full <- left_join(combined_bc_st, air_temp_updated, by = 'date') %>% 
  drop_na() # remove na values 
```

## Exploratory Analysis

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# plot relationship between air temperature and soil temperature
ggplot(data = full, aes(x = air_temp, y = soil_temp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(x = "Air Temperature Degrees Celcius", y = "Soil Temperature Degrees Celcius")
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# plot relationship between black carbon and soil temp
ggplot(data = full, aes(x = b_c, y = soil_temp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(x = "PM2.5 (ppm)", y = "Soil Temperature Degrees Celcius")

# clustering of data, use a histogram to examine the distribution
hist(full$b_c, xlab = 'PM2.5 (ppm)', main = 'Distribution of Black Carbon levels')
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# re-examine black carbon with a log transformation applied to see if relationship improves
ggplot(data = full, aes(x = log_b_c, y = soil_temp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(x = "PM2.5 (ppm)", y = "Soil Temperature Degrees Celcius")


# examine distribution of log transformed black carbon levels
hist(full$log_b_c, xlab = 'log(PM2.5) (ppm)', main = 'Distribution of Black Carbon levels')
```

## Linear Regression and Hypothesis Testing

The additive linear equation model is: $$ soiltemp_i=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} \cdot airtemp_i + \beta_{2} \cdot log(black carbon)_i + \varepsilon_i $$

```{r}
# run linear regression on soil temp using air temp and black carbon as predictors
permafrost_mod_2 <- summary(lm(soil_temp ~ air_temp + log_b_c, data = full))
print(permafrost_mod_2)
```

The interaction equation model is:

$$ soiltemp_i=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} \cdot airtemp_i + \beta_{2} \cdot log(black carbon)_i + \beta_{3} \cdot airtemp_i \cdot log(blackcarbon)_i + \varepsilon_i $$

```{r}
# run linear regression on soil temp using air temp and black carbon as well as an interaction between black carbon and air temperature
permafrost_mod_3 <- lm(soil_temp ~ air_temp + log_b_c + air_temp:log_b_c, data = full)
permafrost_mod_3_summ <- summary(permafrost_mod_3)

# create a table with results displayed from interaction model
permafrost_table <- permafrost_mod_3 %>%
  tab_model()

permafrost_table
```
